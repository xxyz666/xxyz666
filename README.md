⚡ **Fun fact:**
Ai was created to help bugs, I don't understand people who call someone Ai Developer doesn't have such a word and never has been 💀

🎯 **What drives me?**
I am aware that we are invincible and we do not die just as we have the power that drives us and is much faster than humans, we do not do it seriously, but fate wanted it so... (if you don't know what it's about, don't judge)

📚 **My learning journey:**
